    <div class="personal"> Personal interests! <br>When im not playing video games, I would be working on various subjects; such as animation, coding, and pixel art.<br>
        One of my favorite animations i've made was a short gif made in GIMP of V1 from Ultrakill shooting a coin and spliting it.<br>
        I have taken coding classes back when I was in high school, One thing I made was a minigame you played in the console.<br>
        In this game, you were given a range from 1-100, and you had to guess what the number was, with each wrong guess<br>
        the ranges shrunk to the guessed number, and this kept going until the number is corrected guessed by the player.<br>
        Finally, using GIMP I recently started to get into pixel art. I first started with pixel fire sprites and copying NES sprite sheets.</div>
        
        <div class="hobbies"> Hobbies! <br>My hobbies include playing video games, my favorite genres being: Action-adventure, Movement shooters, and RPG's to name a few. <br> 
        I also enjoy listening to music from video games as background noise, I love board games like monopoly and Betrayal at house on the hill. <br>
        This is because I like trying to figure out what my opponents are thinking and seeing if I can outsmart them.</div>
