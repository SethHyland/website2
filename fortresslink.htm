One of the most popular online action games of all time,<br>
Team Fortress 2 delivers constant free game modes, maps, equipment and,<br>
most importantly, hats. Nine distinct classes provide a broad range of tactical abilities<br>
and personalities, and lend themselves to a variety of player skills.
